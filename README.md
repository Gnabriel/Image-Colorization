# Image-Colorization
The goal of this project was to study how a grayscale image can be colorized using a
convolutional neural network (CNN). The method presented in the paper Colorful
Image Colorization, written by R. Zhang et al., was used as reference [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08511). The
data used to train the model presented in this paper is confined to portrait images
of peopleâ€™s faces. The dataset used in this study is thus more narrow than what
is used in the original paper, which is a wide variety of image categories. Two
different loss functions are implemented with results showing that a multinomial
cross-entropy loss function produces much better results than a euclidian loss
function. Although it has been trained for far fewer iterations, the model presented
in this paper colorizes portrait images more realistically in 58% of the cases when
compared to the model presented by R. Zhang et al. in [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08511) in a qualitative study.

See below for some examples of results of images colored by our model compared against the ground truth:
